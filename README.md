# IT Team Principles - Exercise List

A tool we can use to estalish core principles for running a high-performing IT team. Use these as a menu for the team to select, debate, and rank their values.

## 🏗️ Operational Philosophy

1.  **Boring is Good:** We prefer proven, stable technology over the "new and shiny" unless the value proposition is overwhelming. Stability is a feature.
2.  **Automate Yourself Out of a Job:** If you do it three times, script it. We ruthlessly eliminate toil to make room for high-value work.
3.  **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) > Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** Systems will fail. What matters is how fast and gracefully we recover.
4.  **Cattle, Not Pets:** Servers and systems should be disposable and reproducible, not hand-raised and unique.
5.  **Documentation is Code:** If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist. Documentation should be versioned, close to the work, and treated as a first-class citizen.
6.  **Simplicity Wins:** Complexity is the enemy of security and reliability. Choose the simplest solution that works.

## 🤝 Culture & People

7.  **Psychological Safety:** We can admit mistakes, ask "stupid" questions, and challenge ideas without fear of retribution.
8.  **Blameless Post-Mortems:** When things break, we attack the process, not the person. "Who" caused it is irrelevant; "How" the system allowed it is everything.
9.  **Strong Opinions, Loosely Held:** We debate vigorously based on data and experience, but we commit fully once a decision is made. We are open to changing our minds when new data arrives.
10. **Bus Factor > 1:** No single person should be the only one who knows how a critical system works. Knowledge sharing is mandatory.
11. **Respect for Time:** We protect each other's focus time. Meetings require agendas and clear outcomes.
12. **Customer Empathy:** We solve problems for people, not just for computers. We try to understand the user's pain before prescribing a technical pill.

## 🚀 Delivery & Strategy

13. **Ship Small, Ship Often:** We release small, incremental changes to reduce risk and get faster feedback. Big bang releases are forbidden.
14. **Data Over Gut Feel:** We measure what matters. Decisions should be backed by metrics, logs, and observability, not just intuition.
15. **Default to Open:** We work transparently. Information is shared by default unless there is a specific reason to hide it.
16. **You Build It, You Run It:** The team that writes the code or designs the system is responsible for its operation in production.
17. **Security is Everyone's Job:** Security isn't a gate at the end; it's baked into the design and the daily workflow.
18. **Constraint Drives Creativity:** We embrace our limitations (budget, time, legacy systems) and use them to drive innovative solutions.

## 🛡️ "The Grumpy Stack" Specials (Optional Flavor)

19. **No Magic:** We understand how our tools work. Abstractions are useful, but magic is dangerous when it breaks.
20. **Sleep Matters:** No heroics. If the system requires you to wake up at 3 AM regularly, the system is broken, not the person.
